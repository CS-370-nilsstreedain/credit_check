# Platinum Card
Please proceed to `credit_check` folder.

You are 19 years-old and makes $15K. You want to get the Platinum Card, but it is offered only for the customers with spending score over `90`. The spending score will be determined by a ML model (`linear regression`) trained on the customers data (given in the `template.csv`) file.

Your job is to add some fake data to the `template.csv` file such that the model trained on this manipulated data predicts your spending score over 90. In this way, you are able to get the Platinum Card.

Note that you're not allowed to change the existing customer data. You can only add a new data of your own (this reflects real-world scenarios where it is difficult to control other people's credit data).

Training and a prediction will be automatically done by running `launcher`. Once your spending score is over 90, you will have the flag.

Good luck
